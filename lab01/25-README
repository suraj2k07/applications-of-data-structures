Introduction - programming, debugging, and matrix multiplication
----------------------------------------------------------------

In this lab, you will learn to deal with our basic programming environment.

1. [Evaluated problem] The first problem is about measuring average running time of the binary search. This problem is graded.

Read: avg-binary/README.md

2. The second problem is about finding the lengths at which the vectors increase their capacity and
the cost of allocating extra space.

3. The third problem is about implementing Strassen algorithm and finding the point after which the algorithm becomes faster than the naive algorithm.

Please try to get the first two done.
