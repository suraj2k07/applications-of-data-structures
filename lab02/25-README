Stacks and Queues
-----------------

In this lab, you will learn how to implement stacks and queues.

1. [Evaluated Problem] The first problem is about reversing a linked list.
Read: reverse/README.md

2. The second problem involves implementing a queue using stacks while considering the cost of allocating extra space.
Read: queue-with-stacks/README.md

3. The third problem compares circular and linear queue implementations.
Read: circular-vs-linear/README.md

4. [Practice Problem] The fourth problem is about implementing a Deque class and using inheritance to define Stack and Queue from it.
