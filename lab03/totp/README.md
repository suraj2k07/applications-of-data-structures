# VS Code interface

You can open this folder in VS Code. The problem folder is configured 
to enable debugging.

After opening the folder, click on Run > Start Debugging or press F5.
This will run your program on input ./test/test1/input.txt.
You may place breakpoints to pause the program at any desired location.

You can modify "./.vscode/launch.json" to run any test of your choice.

In some labs, there may be multiple binaries, and you may need to modify 
the binary name in the ./.vscode/settings.json file.

```
    "problem": "<binary>",
```
