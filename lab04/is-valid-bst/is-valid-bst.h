/**
 * @brief Check if a binary tree is a valid binary search tree
 * 
 * @param root The root of the binary tree
 * @return true If the binary tree is a valid binary search tree
 * @return false If the binary tree is not a valid binary search tree
 *
 * Your task is to check if the tree indexing all the values of type T is a
 * valid binary search tree, which implies that for each node in the tree,
 * all the values in its left subtree are less than the value of that node, and
 * all the values in its right subtree are greater than the value of that node.
 *
 * You can add helper functions or data structures, but you should not modify
 * the existing function signature. Note that this requiress knowledge about
 * the concpet of smart pointers in C++.
 *
 * Lastly, do not add `using namespace std;` as it is a bad practice.
 * The full problem involves the above task AND the task in the file
 * "employee.h". You should complete both tasks.
